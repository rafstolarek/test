# Inteless PV Home Assistant Example

This repository provides a minimal custom component for Home Assistant that
connects to the Inteless PV open API. The integration logs in using the
`oauth/token` endpoint and exposes a sensor showing the current plant power.

Copy the `custom_components/inteless_pv` folder into your Home Assistant
configuration directory to try it out.
